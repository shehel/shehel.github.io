We are undergoing a revolution in terms of knowledge exchange which I believe requires a lot more press and awareness than it's currently receiving. Massive Open Online Courses(MOOC) and open courseware are at the forefront of this change and I'd like to share my experience with it and show some appreciation through this brief write-up.  

A little bit of background first, rarely any subject taught in school interested me till I joined University for my bachelors joint degree in computer science and business. My fascination with computers spilled over from video games and the theme of 'business' was ever present growing in an household that revolved around the family business. I performed well above average grade-wise but this was mostly due to 'overfitting to information', for lack of a better term. It could be due to the way the subjects were presented to me or how my attitude to school and subjects evolved as a result of the complex interaction between me and my environment(more on this in another time), but 'learning' for me consisted of taking what I was given, building a make-shift boat out of it and setting sail ASAP. As the tides grew bigger, I kept building on this fragile structure and it was not until I had started college that I realised the ship was filled with holes. What made it harder was knowing what to unlearn to fix the mental model. This was when I took my battered ship to the world of online education which was the most optimal path I saw to fulfilling my hopes of a career in research. 

Given below are some of the resources I used including YouTube channels, online courses and MOOCs which I found noteworthy. Ofcourse, this is in tune to pursue advanced research in Machine Learning but given the time, I'll happily go through anything they offer because that's what these educators excel in - transferring the passion for learning.  

No list about online learning resources is complete without mentioning [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) and it goes without saying that it has some of the best content for K-12. A lot of universities offer open courses while a good chunk of professors also make their classes and content available to the public for free. Google and especially the answers in [Quroa](https://www.quora.com/) led me to a lot of great courses simply by typing "Good online resource for [topic name]". Harvard's [Statistics 110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110/home) by Joe Blitzstein, MIT's (Linear Algebra)(https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) by Gilbert Strang and David Massey's videos and text on [Multi-variable calculus](http://centerofmath.org/videos/index.html#subject5) are courses I have personally taken and fully recommend. These courses cover the foundations and what I found most beneficial is that they also provide practice questions and solutions which is imo as important as the videos and handouts. 

A lot of universities have been putting out great MOOCs over the last couple of years, and there's even a [search engine](https://www.class-central.com) for finding them. Knowing if a course is right for you is harder with MOOCs because many are on advanced topics that build on the fundamentals and most often assumes your familiarility with the basics. For example, one that I've completed is FastAI's [Deep learning for coders](http://www.fast.ai/) which can be much harder if you have no prior experience with programming or the python language. It is an excellent course for people looking for learning the best practices and state of the art in applying deep learning to real world problems. 

Another great source is [VideoLectures.NET](http://videolectures.net/) with video lectures on almost every academic topic. I particularly like the one's from Summer School programs, like this [series](http://videolectures.net/site/search/?q=mlss) started in 2002 to promote cross-disciplinary work by providing a crash course in Machine Learning to researchers interested in applying these methods. These schemes host leading scholars in the field and covers a field from the fundamentals to state-of-the-art practice. 

If there's one style of teaching that I find consistently effective in my learning, it's that of Grant Sanderson in his popular YouTube channel [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw/featured). I found the visual intuition first approach particularly effective and worthy of a mention. Talking of style of teaching, these are other sources of inspiration - [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com), [Numberphile](https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

A surprising recent [study](http://news.mit.edu/2014/study-shows-online-courses-effective-0924) from MIT found that the learning in their online version of the course was somewhat greater than in the traditional lecture-based course. Another success story is Scott Young's [MIT challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/) where Scott finished a four year degree in a single year. Note that I'm in no way devaluing the role of academia because learning in a way, is a long discussion we and our ancestors have been a part of and we have yet to find a platform more effective for facilitating such discussions as universities and colleges. Online courses and learning offers another channel to reduce the barrier to get involved in the discussion that I wish more people make use of.
