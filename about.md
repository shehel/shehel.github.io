<h2>Hello!</h2>

Computer Science graduate with an interest in NLP and Bayesian methods, more so at their intersection. 

Constantly trying to understand and improve this loop at a metalevel. Every bit helps :)  
<div class="example">
    <pre>
while alive:
  prior = posterior(xp, prior)
  xp = sense()
    </pre>
</div>
Edit: I think it's broken in multiple levels.
