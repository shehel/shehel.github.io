<h2>Hello!</h2>

Computer Science graduate interested in the scientific and engineering challenges involved in understanding/replicating intelligence. Interested in causality and neural networks.

The occasional write-ups in this space deals with "mind stamps" - a way to record my state of mind at a point in time to log progress if any. So whatever I posted is already outdated and I maybe a totally different person.
